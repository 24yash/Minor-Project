The time-varying forces excite these machines/structures and manifests in their vibratory motion. The vibratory motion greatly influences the stresses and hence the durability and residual life of these complex systems, apart from generating undesired noise. The task for an engineer in designing these systems is ensuring a desired life. It is therefore necessary to develop insights into the vibration phenomenon, so that the issue of undesired vibration levels is addressed at the design stage itself. This course addresses the fundamentals of vibration theory with simple but practical examples with an emphasis on seeing the larger picture and interpreting the outcome of vibration analysis from the context of machinery or structural design. At the end of the course the student will be able to understand the process of modelling any practical vibratory system, its analysis and interpreting the results.      INTENDED AUDIENCE:   Senior Undergraduate / Post-graduate, doctoral students in aerospace or mechanical engineering, practicing engineers from industry willing to get a sound foundation in vibration engineering      PREREQUISITES:   Basic exposure to Engineering Mechanics and Engineering Mathematics would be useful      INDUSTRY SUPPORT:   All the industrial rotating machinery have vibration and noise issues, and there are many critical vibration problems in most aerospace systems including engines and transmissions. Strong foundation and understanding of variety of aspects of the vibration phenomenon is very crucial to analysis and interpretation of issues observed in practical machinery and structures. The course is intended to address fundamental understanding of the vibration theory with emphasis on solution of many practical problems, analysis and interpretation.","Aerospace / Mechanical Engineeringelements of mechanical vibrationABOUT THE COURSE:     It is hard to imagine any mechanical/aerospace system that is not subjected to dynamic excitation force.

It examines three questions - 1. What features (say mountains) and processes (such as volcanism) are found in different locations? 2. Why are they located where they are? 3. Where else on Earth do we find these specific features and processes? This governs several developmental decisions, such as location of mines, factories, towns, cities, and infrastructure. After all, mining will be economically feasible in areas that have a concentration of ores. Factories can easily be set up where we have availability of land, labour, capital and infrastructure. Towns and cities require land, infrastructure, water, etc. But at the same time, areal differentiation also governs the localisation of biodiversity - forests, wildlife, etc. - which need to be conserved to provide us with ecosystem benefits like food, water, disease control and employment. Past experience shows that if we are not careful, hasty developmental decisions harm biodiversity and conservation - especially when, say, developing mines in biodiversity-rich areas.

This is a fast-evolving field and a fundamental approach to coping with NP-hardness, alongside approximation and randomized algorithms. The course will be a natural follow-up to a first course in algorithms and data structures for theoretically-inclined students and those who are curious about approaches to dealing with the theoretical limitations that emerge from the theory of NP-completeness.      Remark 1. A companion course might cover topics focused entirely on lower bounds (covering W-hardness, ETH and SETH-based hardness, hardness based on the UGC, and hardness of kernelization). A natural follow-up course might cover topics in the intersection of parameterized and approximation algorithms.           Remark 2.

In a nutshell, a MPC protocol allows a set of mutually distrusting parties with private inputs, to perform any joint computation on their data, by keeping their respective data as private as possible. Secure MPC abstracts several real-world problems, for example privacy-preserving data mining, privacy-preserving ML, secure e-auctions, private matchmaking, secure set-intersection, secure e-voting, secure signal-processing, secure bioinformatics, secure biometrics, secure outsourcing, to name a few.  Since the domain of secure computation is enormously vast, it is impossible to discuss every relevant topic in just a single course. Hence the plan is to cover the topics in two parts. The first part titled Secure Computation: Part I has been already offered. In that course, we covered a simpler form of adversarial setting, namely semi-honest adversary (passive adversary), where the corrupt parties are supposed to follow protocol instructions. However, real-life attackers may not be so benign and can cause the compromised parties to behave in any arbitrary fashion.

As the latest TIOBE Programming Community Index for August 2021 indicates – C (13%), Python (12%), C++ (7%), Java (10%), and C#(5%) together control nearly half the programming activities worldwide. Further, C Programming Language Family (C, C++, C#, Objective C etc.) dominate more than 25% of activities. Hence, learning C++ is important as one learns about the entire family, about Object-Oriented Programming and gets a solid foundation to also migrate to Java and Python as needed.
C++ is the mother of most general purpose of languages. It is multi-paradigm encompassing procedural, object-oriented, generic, and even functional programming. C++ has primarily been the systems language till C++03 which punches efficiency of the code with the efficacy of OOP. Then, why should I learn it if my primary focus is on applications? This is where the recent updates of C++, namely, C++11 and several later offer excellent depths and flexibility for C++ that no language can match. These extensions attempt to alleviate some of the long-standing shortcomings for C++ including porous resource management, error-prone pointer handling, expression semantics, and better readability.
The present course builds up on the knowledge of C programming and basic data structure (array, list, stack, queue etc.) to create a strong familiarity with C++98 / C++03. Besides the constructs, syntax and semantics of C++ (over C), we also focus on various idioms of C++ and attempt to go to depth with every C++ feature justifying and illustrating them with several examples and assignment problems. On the way, we illustrate various OOP concepts.
The course also covers important advances in C++11 and later released features.                    PRE-REQUISITE:     Programming &amp; Data Structure (mandatory), Programming in C (optional). Design and Analysis of Algorithms (optional).

These include – Microsoft, Samsung, Xerox, Yahoo, Oracle, Google, IBM, TCS, Infosys, Amazon, Flipkart, etc. This course would help industry developers to be up-to-date with the advances in C++ so that they can remain at the state-of-the-art.","Computer Science and EngineeringIntroduction to Machine LearningABOUT THE COURSE :    There has been a continual debate on which programming language/s to learn, to use.

It first develops a simplified model called “radar range equation” to introduce the basic concepts of the Radar. Then it introduces the simple CW Radar and shows it limitations and how that can be overcome with the help of frequency modulation. Then it introduces the concept of pulsed radar to increase the range of the radar detection, Thereafter the concept of MTI filtering to discriminate clutter in the Doppler domain is introduced and performance metric of MTI filtering is introduced. The drawback of MTI filtering in airborne radar is introduced next to highlight the concept of pulsed Doppler radar. Thereafter tracking radar is introduced alongwith monopulse concept to measure angular position of a target with very high accuracy. Then the detection theory is introduced by elaborate description of match filtering, ambiguity function, range resolution and Doppler resolution concepts. Thereafter pulse compression is introduced to increase the downrange resolution and synthetic aperture processing to increase cross range resolution. Thus the concept of the imaging radar is introduced. The statistical nature of target and environment parameter fluctuations is introduced next by introducing the concept of probability of false alarm and probability of detection. Swerling models are introduced and with their help the radar equation model is modified to make it more realistic. The modern trend of close sensing of targets with ground penetrating radar is next introduced and also the topic of radar tomography is introduced to give the course students a thrill of various modern civil, industrial and mining applications of radar technology. This trend of radar technology evolution from defence applications to civilian applications is emphasized at the end of the course.

Then it introduces the concept of pulsed radar to increase the range of the radar detection, Thereafter the concept of MTI filtering to discriminate clutter in the Doppler domain is introduced and performance metric of MTI filtering is introduced. The drawback of MTI filtering in airborne radar is introduced next to highlight the concept of pulsed Doppler radar. Thereafter tracking radar is introduced alongwith monopulse concept to measure angular position of a target with very high accuracy. Then the detection theory is introduced by elaborate description of match filtering, ambiguity function, range resolution and Doppler resolution concepts. Thereafter pulse compression is introduced to increase the downrange resolution and synthetic aperture processing to increase cross range resolution. Thus the concept of the imaging radar is introduced. The statistical nature of target and environment parameter fluctuations is introduced next by introducing the concept of probability of false alarm and probability of detection. Swerling models are introduced and with their help the radar equation model is modified to make it more realistic. The modern trend of close sensing of targets with ground penetrating radar is next introduced and also the topic of radar tomography is introduced to give the course students a thrill of various modern civil, industrial and mining applications of radar technology. This trend of radar technology evolution from defence applications to civilian applications is emphasized at the end of the course.

It is an internationally reputed institution for tuberculosis (TB) research and a WHO Collaborating Centre for TB Research and Training.
Worldwide, there were 10.4 million new tuberculosis (TB) cases and 1.7 million deaths due to TB in 2015. India contributed to nearly 2 million new TB cases. According to the End TB Strategy adopted in 2014, the global milestones relative to 2015 data are 50% reduction in TB incidence, 75% reduction in TB deaths by 2025 and 90% reduction in TB incidence and 95% reduction in TB deaths by 2035. Early diagnosis and treatment of TB by engagement of public and private care providers are identified as important components to achieve these milestones. In India, TB patients seek care both in the public and private sector. Physicians play a vital role in the early diagnosis and treatment of TB patients. They must be aware of the approved technologies for TB diagnosis and appropriate TB treatment regimens Studies have reported poor prescription practices among physicians. This is a major concern and threat for development of drug resistance and mortality in TB patients. Physicians have to be educated and appraised about the evidence-based approach in diagnosis, treatment and public health standards in the management of TB.  
ICMR-NIRT is offeringan online course for Physicians on TB. Manage TBis an online course designed to provide basic information about TB and its management.

It is an internationally reputed institution for tuberculosis (TB) research and a WHO Collaborating Centre for TB Research and Training.
Worldwide, there were 10.4 million new tuberculosis (TB) cases and 1.7 million deaths due to TB in 2015. India contributed to nearly 2 million new TB cases. According to the End TB Strategy adopted in 2014, the global milestones relative to 2015 data are 50% reduction in TB incidence, 75% reduction in TB deaths by 2025 and 90% reduction in TB incidence and 95% reduction in TB deaths by 2035. Early diagnosis and treatment of TB by engagement of public and private care providers are identified as important components to achieve these milestones. In India, TB patients seek care both in the public and private sector. Physicians play a vital role in the early diagnosis and treatment of TB patients. They must be aware of the approved technologies for TB diagnosis and appropriate TB treatment regimens Studies have reported poor prescription practices among physicians. This is a major concern and threat for development of drug resistance and mortality in TB patients. Physicians have to be educated and appraised about the evidence-based approach in diagnosis, treatment and public health standards in the management of TB.  
ICMR-NIRT is offeringan online course for Physicians on TB. Manage TBis an online course designed to provide basic information about TB and its management. The participants will be provided with an overview of the extent of the TB burden globally and nationally, its pathogenesis, diagnostic modalities, treatment regimens, prevention strategies and efforts towards TB elimination. National and International guidelines will be elaborated on and new TB drugs, vaccines and diagnostics will be introduced.

Objectives of the course         •	The course aims to introduce students of literature to the distinctive features of the gothic novel, an immensely popular literary sub-genre from the late eighteenth and nineteenth century.   •	The course deconstructs the narrative ingredients of this subgenre such as the supernatural (assumed and real), madness, and other insidious human behaviour in the context of the social, cultural and historical upheavals that were shaking up the social order of the eighteenth and nineteenth century.   •	The course will also encourage students to explore the different thematic configurations of the gothic such as the “female gothic” and “the imperial gothic” to understand the cultural and historical anxieties reflected and refracted in such narrative consciousness.  •	The course will also expose students to the complications in the gender dynamics embedded within the gothic narrative, and trace the literary and historical conditions that led to the construction of complex characters in this subgenre.

Aristotle’s Poetics is believed to be an incomplete treatise and the work that we have with us today is a systematic attempt to define only one genre, namely the art of tragedy. The treatise explores the various aspects of the genre, providing answers to what goes into the making of a tragedy and how it evokes the right kind of aesthetic response in a spectator. This attempt to systematize the study of poetry or all forms of literary composition is not specific to Greek or western literature but can be found in all literatures worthy of the name. In the Indian  literary history, the term poetics in its broadest sense was concerned with two domains of art, namely nāṭya (play which blended drama, music, and dance) and kāvya (poetry and other forms of literary composition). The factors that distinguished nāṭya from kāvya in terms of form as well as content were so discernible that Sanskrit poetics virtually got bifurcated into two streams, namely nāṭyaśāstra and kāvyaśāstra. The nāṭyaśāstra tradition of poetics, as the term denotes, focused primarily on nāṭya or performance of plays on stage with the accompaniment of dance and music; these aspects were technically termed in Sanskrit as āṅgika (pertaining to gestures) vācika (verbal elements) āhārya (make-up and dress) and sāttvika abhinaya (representation of emotions). Kāvyaśāstra, on the other hand, was exclusively concerned with the ontology of kāvya (poetry and literary prose). The proposed course aims to introduce the students to the eight major schools in Indian aesthetics which functioned as the foundation of these two streams of poetics, such as rasa, dhvani, vakrokti, aucitya, alaṅkāra, anumāna, guṇa and doṣa.

Language is instrumental in constructing meaning and defining associations with our world. As a social phenomenon, it shapes every aspect of our lives and binds us together. Language is a rule-governed system that allows us to communicate and socialize. It is a beautiful product of human mind. Understanding the formal properties of language allows us to produce appropriate utterances and understanding functional aspects of language allows us to make sense out of them. Language is used in a socio-cultural context and meanings are derived according to the speaker's situation in the social space. This course takes the learners on a journey where they get an opportunity to discover Language through various socio-cultural contours; such as: Identity, Gender, Social Class, Culture, Dialects, Bilingualism, Multilingualism, Language Variation and Change, Code-mixing and Hybridity,  Language Policy and Planning, etc. and so many other concepts. This course underlines the role of language and its centrality in organizing our societies and demonstrates how language engages with such concepts.

Language is instrumental in constructing meaning and defining associations with our world. As a social phenomenon, it shapes every aspect of our lives and binds us together. Language is a rule-governed system that allows us to communicate and socialize. It is a beautiful product of human mind. Understanding the formal properties of language allows us to produce appropriate utterances and understanding functional aspects of language allows us to make sense out of them. Language is used in a socio-cultural context and meanings are derived according to the speaker's situation in the social space. This course takes the learners on a journey where they get an opportunity to discover Language through various socio-cultural contours; such as: Identity, Gender, Social Class, Culture, Dialects, Bilingualism, Multilingualism, Language Variation and Change, Code-mixing and Hybridity,  Language Policy and Planning, etc. and so many other concepts. This course underlines the role of language and its centrality in organizing our societies and demonstrates how language engages with such concepts.  It does not require any prior knowledge and training and anyone and everyone can join this exploration of locating language within social and cultural spaces.

In a contemporary globalized world, effective public speaking has become crucial both at individual and organizational levels. Public speaking as verbal talent posits itself as a “cause” with clear motive to “effect” the intended audience. It enables the speaker to have direct impact upon the audience and thus makes it an effective medium to exercise in diverse situations. However, not all the speakers are able to create the intended effect through their act of speaking due to their unfamiliarity with speech techniques and delivery nuances. Many of us, though competent enough, often feel anxiety about speech when called upon to speak in personal and public domains such as interviews, presentations, meetings, conferences, group discussions and many speaking related challenges in the present day ever changing corporate world. The purpose of this public speaking course is to develop the speech and personality of learners in order to convert them into confident, committed and effective speakers. The course will serve as a guide to various forms of public speaking with relevance to numerous emerging situational contexts and provide an overall development in speech delivery in a perspicuous manner.

It enables the speaker to have direct impact upon the audience and thus makes it an effective medium to exercise in diverse situations. However, not all the speakers are able to create the intended effect through their act of speaking due to their unfamiliarity with speech techniques and delivery nuances. Many of us, though competent enough, often feel anxiety about speech when called upon to speak in personal and public domains such as interviews, presentations, meetings, conferences, group discussions and many speaking related challenges in the present day ever changing corporate world. The purpose of this public speaking course is to develop the speech and personality of learners in order to convert them into confident, committed and effective speakers. The course will serve as a guide to various forms of public speaking with relevance to numerous emerging situational contexts and provide an overall development in speech delivery in a perspicuous manner.                  INTENDED AUDIENCE:   Students pursuing their degrees, job aspirants and professionals.              PREREQUISITES:     Anyone interested having the basic knowledge of written and spoken English is eligible to enrol for this course.

This course introduces students to the most important concepts in point set topology. We begin the course by defining topological spaces and introducing various ways to put topologies on sets. Then we introduce the notion of continuous maps which enables us to see how different topological spaces interact with each other. A very special class of topological spaces is metric spaces. Most of our intuition for topology comes from metric spaces. We introduce metric spaces and try to understand the concepts we have learnt so far in this special case. After this we study the topological properties of connectedness, compactness and local compactness. We then introduce another method to put a topology on a set, namely the quotient topology. Finally we end the course with a discussion on when a topology arises from a metric. The main result in this part is Urysohn's Metrization Theorem.    Throughout this course, the emphasis will be on various examples which we encounter often in mathematics, like Euclidean spaces, spheres, subsets of Euclidean spaces, matrices, general linear group, special linear group, orthogonal group, unitary group, special orthogonal group, special unitary group, Grassmannians, projective spaces. Our aim will be to try and see if these spaces are connected, path connected, Hausdorff, compact, locally compact. The focus of this course is not going to be on constructing counterexamples. There are far too many useful things in topology to focus on, and so I feel it would be better to learn these, than spend time on counterexamples which serve little purpose later.    This course will be useful and accessible to students doing a masters in mathematics. The course can also be useful to students in a bachelors program in mathematics, physics or engineering streams, who need mathematics in their studies or have some interest in pure mathematics.                  INTENDED AUDIENCE:         Masters Level Students in Mathematics. However, students in a bachelors program in mathematics or physics or engineering streams, who have had some exposure to set theory and real analysis should also be able to follow easily.                  PREREQUISITES:             We will assume the basics of set theory and real analysis. Please see Assignment 0. This has been uploaded and you will be able to access it by registering for this course. In addition to this, a large class of examples in this course will be n x n matrices and its subsets. You should be comfortable with determinants and some linear algebra.

The course  participants should be, at the end of the course, able to understand the decisions related to capital  budgeting, capital structure, management of working capital, and dividend policy, by way of learning  tools and techniques to solve advanced numerical problems of real business situations efficiently. 
The course shall have four distinct modules, namely investment decisions, financing decisions, working  capital management decisions, and payout decisions. Investment decisions aim to help understand  the valuation of financial securities, and the role of risk-return relationship in making the capital  budgeting decisions. Financing decisions help in determining the right source of capital while keeping  shareholders’ interests a priority. Working capital management decisions focus on optimal management  of inventory, debtors and receivables, and payables. Finally, payout decisions are related to the issues  pertaining to paying dividends or keeping the profits within the business. We shall also consider some  other relevant issues as part of our discussion with respect to financial decision making process.          INTENDED AUDIENCE       :  Undergraduate and postgraduate-level students with

An important advantage of neutrons is that they carry no charge   and can penetrate the bulk of materials. They interact via strong force with the nuclei of the material and the scattering cross section varies randomly between various elements and even between two isotopes of the same element. This allows one to observe light atoms such as hydrogen in the presence of heavier ones and distinguish neighbouring elements in the periodic table easily. Notably, hydrogen and deuterium have large contrast with respect to neutrons. One can exploit isotopic substitution and contrast variation methods in such studies. Since neutron also carries a magnetic moment of -1.91?N, it also interacts with magnetic moment in atoms, making it a unique probe for determination of microscopic magnetic structure.  Wavelength and energy of thermal neutron match with the lattice spacing and excitations in condensed matter and makes it an indispensable tool to study both structure and dynamics in condensed matter.
